Ping â€“ Real-Time Chat App
Ping is a simple and clean real-time chat application built using the MERN stack. It allows users to sign up log in and chat with each other in real time. The app uses Socket.IO for instant messaging and MongoDB for storing messages.

Connected backend with Axios and proxy config

Backend built using Node.js + Express
